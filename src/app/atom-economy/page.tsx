                            Daily aspirin use has been shown to lower the chance of having a first
                            heart attack or stroke, however, there are harmful effects such as
                            increased risk for bleeding in the brain, stomach and intestines. Your
                            doctor (chemists are researchers, doctors are practical) may recommend
                            low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk of a heart attack. In the lower
                            dose, aspirin doesn&apos;t pose the same health risk as full-strength
                            NSAIDs. These medicines are effective at dulling pain, reducing
                            inflammation, and reducing fevers. When used moderately, they are
                            generally considered safe.
