              middlemen. Many people have lost Millions to scams because they
              gave up control of their money. BNZ is designed how cryptocurrency
              was invented. To remove risk and the need to trust other people
              with your money. BNZ does well as a petrochemical, however, the
              crypto has no expectations of work from others. BNZ performs well
              solely due to its design and community. The goal of BNZ with
              property aromaticity is multifaceted. Firstly, we want to develop
              within the reactions of crude oil to chemicals or O2C a catalyst
              which can be reused to bring sustainability to crude oil
              manufacturing. The utility of BNZ is the ability to purchase
              artwork named Ouroboros which each design is unique and
              specialized to you.
